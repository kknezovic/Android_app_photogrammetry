Android augmented reality application in Unity 3D environment using photogrammetrically generated 3D object

Bachelor thesis describes the development of a simple augmented reality application in Unity 3D environment using photogrammetrically generated 3D object.
The purpose of this paper is to get acquainted with the technologies used and to 
analyse its computer science methods in the background of these technologies. This 
thesis clarifies the working principle of the used technologies and development tools. 
It shows a detailed procedure of creating a photogrammetric object from an actual 
object in Meshroom software. The object was reconstructed in Blender software, 
followed by creating the Unity interface in which the object is added and the 
application is created using Vuforia augmented reality software development kit.
